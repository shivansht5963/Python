# Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays. (like vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java).

# Lists need not be homogeneous. It can contain datatypes like integers, strings, as well as objects.

# Lists are mutable, so they can be modified (altered).

# Lists allow duplicating of elements.

# Lists allow us to perform operations such as slicing, searching, adding, and removing elements.
